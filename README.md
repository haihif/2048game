# 2048 Game by C++

Welcome to the 2048 Game by C++ project! This project is a console-based implementation of the popular 2048 game. The goal of the game is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the value of 2048.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 2048 Game by C++ project, you will need to have the following materials:

C++ compiler (e.g. GCC, Clang, etc.)
Console or Terminal Emulator

## Installation and Setup

Download and install a C++ compiler on your computer if you haven't already done so. You can use any compiler that supports C++11 or higher.

Clone or download the source code of the 2048 Game by C++ project from this repository to your computer.

Open a console or terminal emulator on your computer and navigate to the directory where the source code is located.

Compile the source code using your C++ compiler. For example, if you are using GCC, you can use the following command to compile the code:

g++ -std=c++11 -o 2048game 2048Game.cpp

This will create an executable file named 2048game in the same directory.

## Usage

To play the 2048 game, simply run the executable file 2048game in your console or terminal emulator. You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the tiles in the up, down, left, and right directions. The goal of the game is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the value of 2048.
